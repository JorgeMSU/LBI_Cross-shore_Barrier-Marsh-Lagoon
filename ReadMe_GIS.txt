GIS shapefiles and georeferenced maps included in this database were developed to accompany:

	Tenebruso, C., Lorenzo-Trueba, J., Ciarletta, D., Miselis, J., Nichols-O'Neill, S. (submitted). The effect of development and coastal
	engineering on the evolution of a barrier-marsh-lagoon system: Insights from Long Beach Island, New Jersey.


Long Beach Island, New Jersey cross-shore evolution GIS analysis 


Methodology
	
	To track cross-shore geomorphic environment change, historic maps including NOAA t-sheets and nautical charts were georeferenced and 
	digitized in a GIS environment. Polygons were generated for each geomorphic region of interest including barrier,
	backbarrier marsh, lagoon and inland marsh polygons. Total area for each region was calculated each year. Average environment
	cross-shore widths were calculated by dividing environment areas by the field site's alongshore length. Ocean shoreline position
	change was tracked by generating polygons between ocean shorelines of each year of interest. Average cross-shore shoreline position 
	change was calculated by dividing the difference of the total landward and seawars area change by the field site's alongshore length.
	Combining ocean shoreline position change with environment boundary change, overall barrier-backbarrier-lagoon system evolution can be 
	analyzed. 

Map Info

	Maps were georeferenced using the WGS 1984 datum and UTM Zone 18 N projection.

GIS File Info
	
	GIS analysis area of interest covers the section of the barrier-backbarrier-lagoon system unaffected by tidal infleunces including 
	regions adjacent to Barnegat Inlet and Little Egg Inlet. 
	
	Shapefile: backbarrier_1840
			
		Polygons representing 1840 barrier coverage area across field site. 

	Shapefile: backbarrier_marsh_1840
			
		Polygons representing 1840 backbarrier marsh coverage area across field site. Backbarrier marsh defined as marsh region 
		connected to the barrier. 

		Historic map and GIS polygon discrepancy: marsh region near Beach Haven, NJ removed from analysis to prevent marsh loss due to 
		development and therefore distort the calculation of the backbarrier marsh-lagoon boundary change during phase I. Beach Haven was the first significant 
		settlement at LBI that resulted in significant marsh loss due to development during the last stage of phase I. 

	Shapefile: lagoon_1840
			
		Polygons representing 1840 lagoon coverage area across field site. Small islands within lagoon environment are defined
		as lagoon area.
