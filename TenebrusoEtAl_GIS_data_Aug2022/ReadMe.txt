Historic Long Beach Island (LBI), NJ cross-shore GIS analysis ReadMe file


ReadMe file update: Last updated August 18, 2022



GIS shapefiles and georeferenced maps included in this database were developed to accompany:

	Tenebruso, C., Lorenzo-Trueba, J., Ciarletta, D., Miselis, J., Nichols-O'Neill, S. (2022). The effect of development and coastal
	engineering on the evolution of a barrier-marsh-lagoon system: Insights from Long Beach Island, New Jersey.


Long Beach Island, New Jersey cross-shore evolution GIS analysis 


Methodology
	
	To track cross-shore geomorphic environment change, historic maps including NOAA t-sheets and nautical charts were georeferenced and 
	digitized in a GIS environment. Polygons were generated for each geomorphic region of interest including barrier,
	backbarrier marsh, lagoon and inland marsh polygons. Total area for each region was calculated for 1839/1840, 1879, 1934, 1957 and 2022.
	Average environment cross-shore widths were calculated by dividing environment areas by the field site's alongshore length. Ocean shoreline position
	change was tracked by generating polygons between ocean shorelines of each year of interest along with shorelines in 1993, 2007, and 2012. 
	Average cross-shore shoreline position change was calculated by dividing the difference of the total landward and seaward area change by the field 
	site's alongshore length.Combining ocean shoreline position change with environment boundary change, overall barrier-backbarrier-lagoon system 
	evolution can be analyzed. 

Map Info

	Maps were georeferenced using the WGS 1984 datum and UTM Zone 18 N projection.
